<h1 class="title">Project 1 - Maze Solver</h1>
<center>
<b>Due Thursday, February 14, 2013</b><br>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
As we saw in lecture, Ruby provides rich support for tasks that
involve text processing.  For this project, you'll write a Ruby
program that processes text files containing maze data, and you will
analyze that data to determine certain features of each maze.
The goal of this project is to allow you to familiarize yourself
with Ruby's built-in data structures and text processing capabilities.

<h2>Simple Maze Data File Format</h2>

<p>
Mazes are defined in text files according to a format we describe
next, which we refer to as the <i>simple maze data file format</i>.
The <a href = "maze.rb">maze.rb</a> we have provided includes a 
parser for files in this format. In the last part of the project you will have
to write a parser for files in a different format.

<p>
The maze data files have a relatively simple structure.  Here's an
example:
<pre>
  16 0 2 13 11
  0 0 du 123.456 0.123456
  0 1 uldr 43.3 5894.2341 20.0 5896.904
  ...
  path path1 0 2 urdl
  path path2 0 2 drlr
</pre>
<p>

<p> The first line in the file is the maze <em>header</em>.  It
has the form:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;size&gt; &lt;start_x&gt; &lt;start_y&gt; &lt;end_x&gt; &lt;end_y&gt;
</pre>
<p>
These fields indicate (respectively) the size of the maze and the
(x,y) coordinates for the start and end points.  All
mazes are square, so the size indicates both the length and the width.
Coordinates start in the upper left-hand corner of the maze and
increase as they move down and right.  For example, in a maze of size 16, (0,0) is
the upper-left corner, and (15,15) is the lower-right corner.  
With this coordinate system, moving <em>down</em> from a cell increases
its y value, and moving <em>right</em> from a cell increases its x
value.  Thus going up from (5, 8) would take you to (5, 7), going down
would take you to (5, 9); going left or right would respectively
lead to (4, 8) and (6, 8).</p>

<p>
Unlike common mazes that one might find on paper, the start and end 
points are arbitrary points <i>inside the maze</i>.  A valid maze has no
openings in the outer wall.  The outer perimeter of the maze is a single,
solid wall, so you needn't worry about accidentally walking through an open 
wall out into the space outside the maze.
</p>


<p>Every line beyond the first can represent either a <em>cell</em> in the
maze or a <em>path</em> through the maze.  Each cell specifies
where walls are (more precisely <em>are not</em>) in the maze, while
a path is a trip through the maze defined by the cells.  </p>

<p>
Lines representing <em>cells</em> take the form:
<pre>  &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;weights&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>dirs</tt> part is a set of up to four "open wall" characters,
(any combination of 'udlr', representing up, down, left, right),
followed by up to four floating point weights 
(separated by spaces), one per character
in <tt>dirs</tt>. For example,</p>
<pre>  4 7 lur 1.3 5.6 8.2</pre>
<p> indicates that the cell at coordinates (4,7) has openings that
lead left, up, and right from that cell (and thus there is a wall that
prevents movement down).  The characters can appear in
<em>any</em> order, but may only include 'udlr', and each letter may
appear at most once.  A direction is <em>not</em> passable if its
representative character is <em>not</em> in this list.  Similarly,
if a maze specification does not mention a particular cell, then you
can presume that all of that cell's walls are closed.</p>

<p>
Following the list of open walls is a list of <em>weights</em> for
each wall opening.  These appear in the same order as the open walls: in the
example above, the left opening has weight 1.3, the up opening has
weight 5.6, and the right opening has weight 8.2.  We'll explain what
these weights will be used for later.</p>

<p>
Lines representing <em>paths</em> take the form:</p>
<pre>
  path &lt;path_name&gt; &lt;start x&gt; &lt;start y&gt; &lt;move 1&gt;&lt;move 2&gt;...
</pre>
<p> In the simple format, there is one path per line.
Each path consists of
a name, a starting x/y coordinate,  and a list of directions (which
  we'll call "moves"), all concatenated together, that the path
takes to reach its destination.  The start coordinates must consist
  only of integers, and directions may only
include the letters "u," "d," "l," and "r,"; for example:</p>
<pre>
  path path1 0 2 uurrddll
</pre>
The path <tt>path1</tt> starts at coordinates (0,2) and then proceeds up twice,
right twice, down twice, and left twice, to reach its ending point
(which happens to be the same as the starting point).</p>

<p>The <a href = "maze.rb">maze.rb</a> file we have given you will parse in the data in this format.
  The parser is invoked by the mode <tt>print</tt>, which prints its
  results so you can see how it has parsed the different parts of the
  maze.  (You'll change the implementation of <tt>print</tt> before
  finishing the project, as described below.)</p>


<!-- ======================================== -->
<h2>Part 1:  Find Maze Properties</h2>

<p>
The first thing your program will do, of course, is to read in the
maze using the parser provided.  You may assume all maze files
in the simple format are valid.
Your program will then compute various properties
of the maze, according to the command (mode) it is given.  Here are
two simple properties you'll compute: the number of closed cells, and
the number of open walls in each direction.
</p>

<p>
First, if we invoke your script with the mode <tt>closed</tt>, your
script should output one line listing exactly the number of <i>closed cells</i>
in the maze, where a closed cell is
 one with no open walls.
For example,</p>
<pre>
% ruby maze.rb closed maze1
2
</pre>

<p>
Second, if we invoke your script with the <tt>open</tt> mode,
your script should output the number of open walls in each direction,
in the order u, d, l, r.  They should be formatted exactly as appears below.
</p>
<pre>
% ruby maze.rb open maze1
u: 8, d: 8, l: 7, r: 7
</pre>

</p>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<h2>Part 2:  Rank Paths By Cost</h2>

<p> As described in the introduction, some maze files will contain paths.
These paths run from the start cell of the maze to its end cell.  You will
need to use the weights for each opening in the maze to calculate the
<em>cost</em> of each path, and then sort the paths in order of cost
from lowest to highest.  For example, 
if the coordinates (in a simple maze file)</p>
<pre>
  path path1 0 1 drdu
</pre>
<p>appear in a path, and the cell at (0,1) is defined as</p>
<pre>
  0 1 ldr 342.54 958.1 3.126
</pre>
<p>
the cost of the first move in the path will be 958.1 (the weight for
the "d" opening). The cost of a whole path is the <em>sum</em> of the
weight of each opening through which it passes.
</p>

<p> Your program should print a comma separated list of the
<em>name</em> of each path in order of cost from lowest to highest.
<pre>
% ruby maze.rb paths maze2
path1, path2
</pre>
<p>
This means that the path named "path1" was the least expensive, 
the path named "path2" was second least expensive, etc...
</p>

<p>
If a maze contains no paths, your program should simply print <tt>None</tt>.</p>
<pre>
% ruby maze.rb paths maze1
None
</pre>
<p>
The file <tt>maze1</tt> contains <em>no</em> paths, 
so <tt>None</tt> is printed.
</p>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<h2>Part 3:  Pretty-print Maze</h2>

<p>
The textual specification of mazes makes them difficult to understand.
For this part of the assignment, you'll
implement a "pretty-printing" function for mazes.
Your pretty print format will use the following conventions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Each cell will be represented by either a space, the letter "s"
(for the start cell), or the letter "e" (for the end cell).
</li>
<li>Left/right walls will be represented by a pipe character "|",
up/down walls will be represented by a dash "-", and wall junctions
will be represented with a plus "+".</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program will print a maze in this format when executed with
the "print" command.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
% ruby maze.rb print maze1
+-+-+-+-+
|s|   | |
+ + + +-+
|       |
+-+ + + +
|     | |
+ +-+ +-+
| | |  e|
+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<p>
In this example, the maze starts at (0,0) and ends at (3,3).
Each cell is represented by " ", "s", or "e"; walls
are represented by "|" or "-", and are joined by "+" characters.
</p>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<h2>Part 4:  Decide Whether Maze Is Solvable</h2>

<p>
Now we want to use your script to determine whether or not a maze
can be solved.  The way we recommend you do this is by actually
finding a path from the start to the end (that is, by solving the
maze!).
</p>

<p>
We recommend you do this by implementing <a href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first</a>
or <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first
search</a> for you maze representation.  If, after exploring all cells
that are reachable (through open walls) from the start cell, you have
not reached the end cell, the maze cannot be solved.  If you encounter
the end cell while traversing the maze, there exists a path from start
to finish, and the maze can be solved.  There may be multiple paths
from the start cell of a maze to its end cell, but your program
<em>need only find one</em>.
</p>

<p>
Note that you do <em>not</em> need to return the length of the path
from start to finish&mdash;your program will only need indicate whether a
path <em>exists</em> by printing "true" when a maze can be solved and
"false" otherwise.</p>
<pre>
% ruby maze.rb solve maze1
true
</pre>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<h2>Part 5:  Parse Standard Maze Files </h2>

Standard maze files use a more complex file format, described below.
If we invoke your script with the mode <tt>parse</tt>, your
script needs to read in and parse a standard maze file 
using Ruby regular expressions, then output
the maze in the simple maze file format.  
<p>
Some lines in a standard maze file may not be exactly in the format
specified.  If any such invalid lines exist, your script should output 
<tt>invalid maze</tt> followed by each invalid line in the maze
file. The goal is primarily to find formatted input, not invalid
mazes (e.g., ones in which one cell defines a wall while the other
does not define the corresponding wall); you can assume we will always
provide mazes that, if the input parses properly, yields a
self-consistent maze.

<p>For example
<pre>
% ruby maze.rb parse maze1-std
<i>...prints out maze1-std in simple maze format...</i>

% ruby maze.rb parse maze3-std
invalid maze
<i>...prints out all invalid lines in maze3-std...</i>
</pre>
<p>
In addition, path names in standard maze files containing
escaped quotes (e.g., \"path1\") must be converted
to path names with normal quotes (e.g., "path1") in
the standard maze file output.

<p> Now we describe the standard maze file format in full detail.
Standard maze files differ as follows from their simple counterparts.
Here's an example:
<pre>
  maze: 16 0:2 -> 13:11
  0,0: du 123.456,0.123456
  0,1: uldr 43.3,5894.2341,20.0,5896.904
  ...
  "path1:(0,2),u,r,d,...,l","path2:(0,2),d,r,l,...,r"
</pre>
<p>

<p> A standard file contains several lines of text according to  
the following format.  The first line is the header, as in the
  simple case, and is now formatted as follows:</p>
<pre>
  maze: &lt;size&gt; &lt;start_x&gt;:&lt;start_y&gt; -> &lt;end_x&gt;:&lt;end_y&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Notice that now the line begins with the keyword <tt>maze</tt>,
uses separate delimiters in various places (commas or colons instead
of spaces), and has a textual arrow <tt>-></tt> between the starting
and ending coordinates.  Lines missing any of the above formatting
(<tt>maze</tt> keyword, colons, etc.) or having any extra fields
are invalid. </p>  

<p>
Lines representing <em>cells</em> take the form:
<pre>
  &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;: &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;weights&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Following the coordinates (x and y, separated by a comma) 
is a colon, a space, a
set of up to four "open wall" characters ('udlr'), and a comma-separated list of
floating point weights (with no space between the commas).
Recall the following cell earlier specified in the simple format:</p>
<pre> 4 7 lur 1.3 5.6 8.2</pre>
Here is the same specification in the standard format: </p>
<pre>  4,7: lur 1.3,5.6,8.2</pre>
It is acceptable for weights to be negative.

<p>
Lines representing <em>paths</em> take the form:</p>
<pre>
  "path1_name:(&lt;start x&gt;,&lt;start y&gt;),&lt;move 1&gt;,&lt;move 2&gt;,...","path2_name:(&lt;start x&gt;,&lt;start y&gt;),..."
</pre>
<p> There are several differences with how paths are formatted in standard
  maze files, compared to simple maze files.  First, each line of text may
  contain more than one path, with each path contained within
  a pair of quotation marks (") and separated by commas.  Note that
path names can contain any character except space or colon, and quotation marks
in path names will be <em>escaped</em> (\").  The first line in the
example below shows two path specifications; each path is identified
by the second line (which would not appear in an actual data file):</p>
<pre>
  "path1:(0,2),l,...","path\"2\":(0,2),d,..."
<i>  [   first path    ] [     second path     ] </i>
</pre>
Note that in these examples the second path contains two escaped quote
characters; there is no requirement that escaped quotes correspond to
open and closed marks, i.e., you can have any number of escaped quotes
in a path's name. 

<p>
In the example</p>
<pre>
  "hello-world:(0,2),u,r,d,...","goodbye-world:(0,2),d,r,..."
</pre>
<p>
The first path (named "hello-world") starts at (0,2), continuing to
(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), and so on.  The second path (named 
"goodbye-world") also starts at (0,2), but 
instead moves to (0,3), (1,3) and so on.</p>

<p> If any path names contain escaped quotes, they must
be converted to normal quotes.
For instance the names 
<tt>path\"3\"</tt> and <tt>\"path4\"</tt> 
should be converted to
<tt>path"3"</tt> and <tt>"path4"</tt> 
in the simple maze file format output.</p>

For examples of how standard maze files are parsed 
and used to generate simple maze files (or report errors), look at the

and

<h2>Hints and Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>This project is non-trivial, in part because you will probably be
writing in Ruby for the first time, so be sure to start right away,
and come to office hours if you get stuck.

<li>
Follow good program development practices:  Test each part of your
program as you develop it.  Start developing a simplified solution and
then add features as you are sure that earlier parts work.  Test early
and often, and re-run your tests as you add new features to be sure
you didn't break anything.

<li>
Before you get too far, review the Ruby class reference, and look for
classes and methods that might be helpful.  For example, the Array and
Hash classes will come in handy.  Finding the right class might save
you a lot of time and make your program easier to develop.

<li>
If you write methods that should return a true or false value,
remember that a Ruby 0 is not false.

<li>
Ruby has an integrated debugger, which can be invoked by running Ruby
with the -rdebug option.  The debugger's <tt>p</tt> command may be
helpful for viewing the values of variables and data structures.  The

<tt>var local</tt> command prints all of the local variables at the
current point of exclusion.  The chapter <a href = "http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/trouble.html">When Trouble Strikes</a> of The
Pragmatic Programmer's Guide discusses the debugger in more detail.

<li>
To thoroughly debug your program, you will need to
construct test cases of your own, based on the project description. If
you need help with this, please come to TA office hours.

<li>
Remember to save your work frequently---a power failure, network
failure, or problem with a phone connection could cost many hours of
lost work.  For the same reason, submit your project often.  You can
retrieve previously-submitted versions of your program from the submit
server should disaster strike.

<li>
Be sure you have read and understand the project grading policies in
the course syllabus.  Do this well in advance of the project due date.
</ul>

<!-- ======================================== -->
<h2>Code Reviews</h2>

Following the submission and grading of this project (details below),
you will be asked to perform code reviews on the projects of two
other students.  Part of your final project grade will be determined
by the quality of the reviews <i>you write</i>. That is, if you don't
submit the reviews, or do not a good job with them, you will lose
points.  Conversely, getting a bad review from someone does not affect
your grade (though of course you take their feedback into account!).
The code review will constitute 1/16 of the total score for the project.

<p>
A good code review will
<ul>
  <li>Point out unnecessarily complicated coding idioms, and suggest
  simpler alternatives. For example, suggest refactoring a large
  method into several smaller ones. Or suggest abstracting out certain
  functionality into a separate, more generic class.
  <li>Point out where comments would be useful, or where comments are
  unnecessary or too verbose
  <li>Highlight unhelpful variable or method names and suggest alternatives
  <li>Identify inconsistent formatting and/or naming/usage conventions
  <li>Identify possible errors/incomplete logic
  <li>Ask questions about the rationale for some bit of code
  <li>Compliment particularly simple and effective code constructions
</ul>
You may wish to look on-line for coding guidelines for Ruby and see
whether the code conforms to them.

<!-- ======================================== -->
<h2>Project Submission</h2>

You should submit a file <tt>maze.rb</tt> containing your solution.
You may submit other files, but they will be ignored during grading.
We will run your solution by invoking:</p>
<center><tt>ruby maze.rb &lt;<i>mode</i>&gt; &lt;<i>file-name</i>&gt;</tt></center>
<p>
where <tt>&lt;mode&gt;</tt> describes what the tool should do (see
above), and <tt>&lt;file-name&gt;</tt> names the file containing the
maze data.  </p>

<p>
<b>Be sure to follow the project description exactly.</b> Your solution
will be graded automatically, and so any deviation from the
specification will result in losing points. In particular, if you have
any debugging output in your program, be sure to turn it off before
you submit your program.
</p>

You can submit your project in two ways:

<ul>
<li>
Submit your maze.rb file directly to the 
<a href="http://submit.cs.umd.edu">submit server</a> 
by clicking on the submit link in the column "web submission".

<p>
<img src="submit1.jpg">
<p>

Next, use the submit dialog to submit your maze.rb file directly.

<p>
<img src="submit2.jpg">
<p>

Select your file using the "Browse" button, 
then press the "Submit project!" button.  
You <b>do not</b> need to put it in a Jar or Zip file.

<p>
<li>
Submit directly by executing a Java program on a computer
with Java and network access.  Included in p1.zip 
are the following files:

<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="submit.jar">submit.jar</a>
<li> <a href=".submit">.submit</a> (Your OS may prevent you from seeing this file because it believes it is a system file)

<li> <a href="submit.rb">submit.rb</a>
</ul>
<p>

The files should be in the directory containing your project. 
From there you can either execute submit.rb, or type the 
following command directly:

<center>
<tt>
java -jar submit.jar
</tt>
</center>
<p>

The first time you submit this way
you will be asked to enter your linuxlab class account and password. 
All files in the directory (and its subdirectories) will then be
put in a jar file and submitted to the submit server.  
If your submission is successful you will see the message:
<p> 

<center>

<tt>
Successful submission #<submission_number> received for project 1
</tt>
</center>
<p>

</ul>


<!-- ======================================== -->
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>
The Campus Senate has adopted a policy asking students to include the
following statement on each assignment in every course: "I pledge on
my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance
on this assignment."  Consequently your program is requested to
contain this pledge in a comment near the top.

<p>

Please <b>carefully read</b> the academic honesty section of the
course syllabus.  <b>Any evidence</b> of impermissible cooperation on
projects, use of disallowed materials or resources, or unauthorized
use of computer accounts, <b>will be submitted</b> to the Student
Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course, or
suspension or expulsion from the University.  Be sure you understand
what you are and what you are not permitted to do in regards to
